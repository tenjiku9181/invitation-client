                <p class="mt-4 text-center cg_s text-lg">In Vietnamese weddings, it is common to invite a much larger
                    number of
                    guests compared to weddings in Japan. In addition to family, relatives, coworkers, and friends, even
                    neighbors or people the couple has interacted with just once may be invited. This reflects the
                    Vietnamese culture that values human connections, and the couple’s desire to have as many people as
                    possible witness this important milestone. It’s not unusual for 200 to 300 guests to gather at the
                    venue.</p><img src="/src/assets/vietnam-wedding-1.jpeg"

                <p class="text-3xl text-gold mb-2 mt-8 text-center cg_s">Flexible Dress Code</p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-center cg_s text-lg">In Vietnamese weddings, there is no strict dress code like
                    “suits” or
                    “pastel-colored dresses.” Some guests wear formal clothes, while others come in casual outfits.
                    Especially in rural areas, it's common for guests to wear something close to everyday clothes.
                    However, if you are close to the bride and groom (like a best friend or sibling), it’s polite to
                    dress up nicely. Since there are many photo opportunities, guests often care about how they look,
                    and recently, more young people enjoy dressing up for the occasion.</p><img

                <p class="mt-4 text-center cg_s text-lg">Since many of you will be traveling all the way from Japan to
                    Vietnam,
                    please feel free to join the wedding WITHOUT bringing any monetary gift. Guests in Vietnam may bring
                    cash gifts as part of the local custom, but please don’t feel obligated — just come in and enjoy the
                    celebration with us.</p><img src="/src/assets/deco13.png" class="m-auto mb-4 mt-8 w-20">
